# AI Face Filters with Haar Cascade

Simple snapchat-like face filters using OpenCV's native haarcascades

### Setup
1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies
2. Run `python server.py` to run the program after installing dependencies

If everything went well a popup for OpenCV's VideoCapture window should open and the filters should be applied in real-time

Good luck
