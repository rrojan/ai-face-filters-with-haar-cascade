# AI Face Filters with Haar Cascade

Simple snapchat-like face filters using OpenCV's native haarcascades

### Setup
1. Run `setup.sh` (creates a virtualenv with dependencies installed)
2. Run `python main.py` to run the program.

If everything went well a popup for OpenCV's VideoCapture window should open and the filters should be applied in real-time

Good luck
